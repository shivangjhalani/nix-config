#  Tmux plugins can be also configured using programs.tmux.plugins. They can be found as NixOS packages: tmuxPlugins. Each of the tmux plugin is run via run-shell automatically. Some plugins need to be run after having had some custom configuration done>, but extraConfig gets executed after. For example tmuxPlugins.cpu needs the status line be declared before the plugin is run. For that scenario, run-shell can be added within extraConfig:
#
#  programs.tmux = {
#    enable = true;
#    extraConfig = ''
#      ...
#      set -g status-right '#[fg=black,bg=color15] #{cpu_percentage} ï€— %H:%M '
#      run-shell ${pkgs.tmuxPlugins.cpu}/share/tmux-plugins/cpu/cpu.tmux
#    '';
#  }

}
